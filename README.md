## Ryo

Ryo is a Discord bot that provides rather simple commands for your server. It is written in Javascript and uses the [Discord.js](https://discord.js.org) library.

> This is still a work in progress, and it's a rewrite of [natsukii](https://github.com/amemiya-nazuna/natsukii), just in JS.

### Commands

- `/ping`

### TODO

- [x] Add a command
- [x] Better handlers
- [ ] Make a website since I'm bored and I think that's what I'm better at
- [ ] Host 24/7

### Setup

1. Clone the repo: `git clone https://github.com/eligibilityy/ryo.git`
2. Rename `.env.example` to `.env` and fill in the values:

```python

CILENT_ID=
GUILD_ID=
```

3. `npm i`
4. Check if it works: `npm run test`
